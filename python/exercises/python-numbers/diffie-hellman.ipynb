    "## Notes\n",
    "Python, as of version 3.6, includes two different random modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "The module called `random` is pseudo-random, meaning it does not generate true randomness, but follows an algorithm that simulates randomness. Since random numbers are generated through a known algorithm, they are not truly random.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `random` module is not correctly suited for cryptography and should not be used, precisely because it is pseudo-random.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, in version 3.6, Python introduced the `secrets` module, which generates cryptographically strong random numbers that provide the greater security required for cryptography.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this is only an exercise, `random` is fine to use, but **note that it would be very insecure if actually used for cryptography**."
